description: A definition for a GPIO-controlled switch.

compatible: "regulator-gpio"

# NOTE: GPIO polarity is defined by the enable-gpios flags, as
# Zephyr does not have the legacy devicetree problem that requires
# Linux to use a separate enable-active-high property.
#
# Also Zephyr uses label instead of regulator-name.
