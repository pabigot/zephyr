    Bindings for the Maxim DS3231 I2C RTC/TCXO

        32 KiHz open drain output

        The DS3231 defaults to providing a 32 KiHz square wave on this
        signal.  The driver does not make use of this, but applications
        may want access.

        interrupt/square wave open drain output

        The DS3231 uses this signal to notify when an alarm has
        triggered, and also to produce a square wave aligned to the
        countdown chain.  Both capabilities are used within the driver.
        This signal must be present to support time set and read
        operations that preserve sub-second accuracy.
