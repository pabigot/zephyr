    This binding provides resources required to build and run the
    samples/drivers/nrf_timer test.

compatible: "test,nrf-timer"

properties:
    tick-rtc:
      type: phandle
      required: false
      description: |
        Reference to the RTC peripheral used as the system tick timer.
        If absent uses NRF_RTC1 which is hard-coded as the tick timer.
        CC[0] is by the tick timer for alarms; CC[1] is used by this
        application for triggered capture.

    hf-timer:
      type: phandle
      required: true
      description: |
        Reference to the TIMER peripheral used as the high-frequency
        clock.  This timer must support 32-bit mode.  In this
        application CC[0] is used to read the timer; CC[1] is used for
        triggered capture.

    int-gpios:
        type: phandle-array
        required: true
        description: |
          Identity of a GPIO that will be connected to the 1pps signal
          and serve as the trigger for an interrupt in which the ticks
          counter will be captured.

    hf-gpios:
        type: phandle-array
        required: true
        description: |
          Identity of a GPIO that will be connected to the 1pps signal
          and serve as the trigger for a GPIOTE input event connected to
          an TIMER capture task.

        type: phandle-array
        required: true
