config APP_SET_ALIGNED_CLOCK
	bool "Option to align RTC with time-since-boot"
	help
	  If enabled this reads the RTC then sets it so that uptime
	  shows as being relative to the start of the next hour.

config APP_ALIGNED_CLOCK_POSIX
	int "Optional time to use when aligning the RTC"
	depends on APP_SET_ALIGNED_CLOCK
	help
	  If provided this value, rather than the current RTC value,
	  will be used when aligning the RTC with time-since boot.

	  The value should be the number of seconds since
	  1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.  For example, 1546300800 corresponds
	  to 2019-01-01T00:00:00Z.
